A simple rails app for one of my former clients. The client is a local education company that specializes on short term professional offline courses. The app has now (6.11.2016):
- Static pages.
- News.
- Hot offers.
- Courses â€“ with an average complexity of content structure, with search.
- Feedbacks (Testimonials).
- Backend-Administration written from scratch to fit this project.

The client is no more on the market and they have granted me the permission to publish the code. Because the app is no more used and, apparently, will not be, I do not pay attention to the "found security vulnerability" aler box that gihub shows here.
