A simple rails app for one of my former clients. The client is a local education company that specializes on short term professional offline courses. The app has now (6.11.2016):
- Static pages.
- News.
- Hot offers.
- Courses â€“ with an average complexity of content structure, with search.
- Feedbacks (Testimonials).
- Backend-Administration written from scratch to fit this project.

The client is no more on the market and they have granted me the permission to publish the code.
